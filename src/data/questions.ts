    question: 'What is the KEY diagnostic feature that distinguishes prostatic adenocarcinoma from benign prostatic glands?',
    options: [
      'Presence of prominent nucleoli',
      'Absence of basal cell layer',
      'Infiltrative growth pattern',
      'AMACR positivity',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Absence of basal cell layer',
    rationale: 'While adenocarcinoma often has prominent nucleoli, infiltrative growth, and AMACR positivity, the KEY diagnostic feature is the absence of the basal cell layer. This can be confirmed with p63 and HMWK immunostains.',
    category: 'Prostate',

  {
    id: 'q_prostate_002',
    question: 'Which of the following is a common MIMIC of prostatic adenocarcinoma?',
    options: [
      'Nodular hyperplasia (BPH)',
      'Post-atrophic hyperplasia',
      'Seminal vesicle epithelium',
      'All of the above',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'All of the above',
    rationale: 'Post-atrophic hyperplasia can show crowded small glands; seminal vesicle can have nuclear atypia; even BPH can rarely mimic cancer. All require careful morphologic assessment and IHC when needed.',
    category: 'Prostate',

  {
    id: 'q_bladder_001',
    question: 'Which feature is MOST helpful in distinguishing flat CIS from reactive atypia?',
    options: [
      'Nuclear enlargement',
      'Loss of maturation and polarity',
      'Presence of inflammation',
      'Umbrella cell prominence',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Loss of maturation and polarity',
    rationale: 'While nuclear enlargement can occur in both, the loss of maturation and polarity throughout all urothelial layers is the hallmark of CIS. Reactive atypia preserves maturation from base to surface.',

    id: 'q_bladder_002',
    question: 'Invasion of which structure defines T2 bladder cancer?',
    options: [
      'Lamina propria',
      'Muscularis mucosae',
      'Muscularis propria',
      'Perivesical fat',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Muscularis propria',
    rationale: 'T2 is defined by invasion into the muscularis propria (detrusor muscle). T1 is lamina propria invasion. Muscularis mucosae invasion is still T1. Perivesical fat invasion is T3.',

  {
    id: 'q_kidney_001',
    question: 'Which IHC stain is MOST useful in distinguishing chromophobe RCC from oncocytoma?',
    options: [
      'c-KIT (CD117)',
      'Hale\'s colloidal iron',
      'PAX8',
      'AMACR',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Hale\'s colloidal iron',
    rationale: 'Both chromophobe and oncocytoma are positive for c-KIT. Hale\'s colloidal iron is positive in chromophobe RCC (diffuse cytoplasmic) and negative in oncocytoma. CK7 pattern also helps (diffuse in chromophobe, focal/negative in oncocytoma).',

      'CK7+++, CA-IX−, AMACR+++',
      'CK7−, CA-IX−, c-KIT+++',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'CK7−, CA-IX+++, AMACR−',
    rationale: 'Clear cell RCC is characteristically CK7 negative, CA-IX strongly diffuse positive, and AMACR negative. This pattern helps distinguish it from papillary RCC (CK7+, AMACR+) and chromophobe (CK7+, c-KIT+).',

      'CD30',
      'SALL4',
      'PLAP',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'CD30',
    rationale: 'CD30 is diffusely positive in embryonal carcinoma and negative in seminoma. OCT3/4 and SALL4 are positive in both. CD30 is the key distinguishing marker.',

      'Embryonal carcinoma',
      'Yolk sac tumor',
      'Choriocarcinoma',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Yolk sac tumor',
    rationale: 'Glypican-3 is a sensitive and specific marker for yolk sac tumor. It is negative in seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, and choriocarcinoma.',
    category: 'Testis',

      'p63+, HMWK−, AMACR−',
      'p63−, HMWK+, AMACR−',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'p63−, HMWK−, AMACR+',
    rationale: 'Adenocarcinoma shows loss of basal cells (p63 and HMWK negative) and typically shows strong granular AMACR positivity. This is the classic malignant pattern.',
    category: 'IHC',

    options: [
      'Prostatic adenocarcinoma',
      'Urothelial carcinoma',
      'Renal cell carcinoma',
      'Germ cell tumor',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Urothelial carcinoma',
    rationale: 'GATA3 is a sensitive and specific marker for urothelial carcinoma (also positive in breast carcinoma). It is useful in identifying urothelial origin of poorly differentiated tumors.',

      'TMPRSS2-ERG fusion',
      'VHL pathway inactivation',
      'MET mutations',
      'TFE3 fusion',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'VHL pathway inactivation',
    rationale: 'VHL inactivation and 3p deletion/loss occur in ~90% of clear cell RCC. This leads to HIF accumulation and pseudo-hypoxia state driving tumor growth.',
    category: 'Molecular',
  },
  {
    id: 'q_molecular_002',
    question: 'TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is most commonly associated with which malignancy?',

      'Urothelial carcinoma',
      'Prostatic adenocarcinoma',
      'Renal cell carcinoma',
      'Testicular germ cell tumor',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Prostatic adenocarcinoma',
    rationale: 'TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is the most common genetic alteration in prostate cancer (~50% of cases). It can be detected by ERG immunohistochemistry.',

    id: 'q_pitfalls_001',
    question: 'What is the most common pitfall in prostate biopsy diagnosis?',

      'Overcalling high-grade PIN as cancer',
      'Confusing atrophy with adenocarcinoma',
      'Missing perineural invasion',
      'Incorrect Gleason grading',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Confusing atrophy with adenocarcinoma',
    rationale: 'Atrophy (especially post-atrophic hyperplasia) is the most common mimic of prostatic adenocarcinoma due to crowded small glands. Always check for basal cells with IHC if uncertain.',

      'Lamina propria',
      'Muscularis propria',
      'Submucosa',
      'Serosa',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Muscularis propria',
    rationale: 'Muscularis mucosae are thin wisps of smooth muscle in superficial lamina propria. Muscularis propria consists of thick organized bundles. Invasion into muscularis mucosae is T1, not T2.',

      'Differentiated PeIN',
      'Basaloid carcinoma',
      'Lichen sclerosus',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Basaloid carcinoma',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Anti-GBM disease (Goodpasture)',
    rationale: 'Linear IgG along the glomerular basement membrane is characteristic of anti-GBM disease. Membranous shows granular IgG. IgA nephropathy shows mesangial IgA. Minimal change is typically IF negative.',

      'Embryonal carcinoma',
      'Yolk sac tumor',
      'Choriocarcinoma',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Yolk sac tumor',
    rationale: 'Schiller-Duval bodies (glomeruloid structures with central vessel surrounded by tumor cells) are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumor, though not always present.',

    correctAnswer: 'Chromophobe RCC',
    rationale: 'Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (FLCN gene mutation) is associated with chromophobe RCC and oncocytoma. VHL syndrome is associated with clear cell RCC. Hereditary papillary RCC syndrome involves MET mutations.',

      'Changes the Gleason score',
      'Is highly specific for malignancy',
      'Requires immediate treatment',
      'Always indicates high-grade disease',

    correctAnswer: 'Is highly specific for malignancy',
    rationale: 'Perineural invasion is highly specific for prostatic adenocarcinoma. It does NOT change the Gleason score but should be reported. It does not automatically indicate high-grade disease.',
